I wonder if I could ask you to help me to lift this firewood. I have just arrived home from a long journey and I am too weak and injured to lift it myself. My name is Torkana. If you could please pick up that firewood and bring it into my hut, I would be most grateful.
I was just in the town of Merami. A dragon and other creatures have taken over the town and the villagers are in great need of assistance. Unfortunately I was injured in battle and was barely able to make it back here alive. I fear that I am not well enough to continue to battle these creatures and I do not know what will become of the townspeople if the creatures are left unchecked. Every village and town in the area will become uninhabitable and everything that we hold dear will be destroyed.
Please, put down the wood. It is so heavy, but you are obviously quite strong, much like I was in my younger days. In fact, you remind me of myself at your age. I wonder if you might be willing to help me a bit more and accompany me on a journey. We would be returning to Merami to battle the dragon and the creatures that have over run the city. The journey would require bravery and quick thinking but I think that you are up for the challenge.
I will start a fire so we may warm up before our journey. While I am doing that, would you please go down to my cellar. There are some tools down there that would be useful to you on the quest. I have locked them all in a chest in the back room of the basement. The key to the chest is on the top shelf in the front room. It is dark down there so here is a candle to light your way.
Excellent job! You have demonstrated courage, intelligence, kindness and perseverance—all characteristics that will serve you well as you continue on this journey.
We will head to Merami momentarily. First let’s warm up a bit. Along the way to Merami we should stop to visit the healer. I am hopeful that he will be able to help me so I am well enough to continue on the journey to Merami with you. You would also do well to visit him and ensure that you are in good health.

Excellent! If you feel you are prepared, we will head to Merami momentarily.

We are going to need that map. Could you go get it?
Don’t let your fear take over. If you are fearful, face your fear.
Doctor Walsh, meet my friend and fellow warrior. We are here because I am weak and injured from a battle with creatures from afar. Would you tend to my wounds?
Young warrior, to treat Torkana I am in need of an herb that grows in the garden behind the house. It is small, yellow, and brown and grows at the edge of the garden. Would you be so kind to retrieve some of these?
