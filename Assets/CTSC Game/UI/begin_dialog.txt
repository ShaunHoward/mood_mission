Although your village has always been a safe haven, things have changed in the surrounding areas. You have heard stories of dragons and strange creatures moving into neighboring towns and you have seen fleeing townspeople in the woods, sometimes begging for food. Everyone in your village lives in fear of the day when the creatures will intrude into your village and life will be forever changed. 
You have heard stories of a great warrior named Torkana who has been traveling from town to town battling the dragon and other creatures. Lore says that Torkana lives out in the woods alone, but few have seen his hut and its location is unknown.
As you walk home from school, you are preoccupied by worries about your uncle, who lives in the neighboring village of Merami. You have heard that Merami is being overrun by creatures. It has been over a week since you have heard from your uncle and you do not even know if he is still alive. You look up and realize that you missed a turn to go home and wandered deeper into the woods than you have ever been. You enter a clearing and see a little hut. A person emerges from the hut and walks to a pile of firewood a short distance from the hut, then sees you and greets you wearily.
I wonder if I could ask you to help me by gathering firewood out in my backyard. I just arrived home from a long journey, and I am too weak and injured to lift it myself. My name is Torkana. If you could please pick up that firewood and bring it into my hut, I would be most grateful.
I was just in the town of Merami. A dragon and other creatures have taken over the town, and the villagers are in great need of assistance. Unfortunately I was injured in battle and was barely able to make it back here alive. I fear that I am not well enough to continue to battle these creatures. I do not know what will become of the townspeople if the creatures are left unchecked. Every village and town in the area will become uninhabitable. Everything that we hold dear will be destroyed.
Torkana: Please, put down the wood. It is so heavy, but you are obviously quite strong, much like I was in my younger days. In fact, you remind me of myself at your age. I wonder if you might be willing to help me a bit more by accompanying me on a journey to a town through the forest. The town is called Merami, where a dragon has lately inhabited the surrounding areas of. We must battle the dragon before creatures have overrun the city. The journey will require bravery and quick thinking, but from what I have seen of you, you will be brave enough to handle the challenge.
I will stoke the fire so we can warm up before our journey. While I am doing that, would you please go down to my cellar? There are some tools down there that would be useful to you on the quest. I have locked them all in a chest in the back room of the basement. The key to the chest is somewhere in the back room. It is dark down there so take this candle to light your way.
And so your adventure begins…
You candle has blown out due to the cold draft down here. You should try to relight it. Matches may be useful but watch out for spiders!
Torkana said he wanted you to gather supplies from a chest but mentioned it was locked. Try looking around in the back room for the key.
Now open the chest!
Torkana: Excellent job! You have demonstrated courage, intelligence, kindness and perseverance—all characteristics that will serve you well as you continue on this journey.
When you are prepared, we will head to Merami. I will meet you outside.
